Problem 1
=========

Generate a uniform distribution from 0 to 5.

``` r
rand_samp = runif(10, min = 0, max = 5)
rand_samp
```

    ##  [1] 2.5470537 1.4635729 3.0610496 0.3345532 4.3588646 3.5506194 2.0051196
    ##  [8] 1.8482695 0.4588550 3.6007795

The mean of the sample is 2.3228737.

Generate a logical vector, which indicates whether the elements in the sample are greter than 2.

``` r
rand_samp_greater_than_2 = rand_samp > 2
rand_samp_greater_than_2
```

    ##  [1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE

The mean of the logical vector is 0.6.

Generate a character vector, which includes ten elements.

``` r
rand_char = c("My", "name", "is", "Qinyao", "how", "are", "you", "nice", "weather", "today")
```

The mean of the character vector is NA.

``` r
rand_factor = factor(c("january", "february", "march", "april", "may", "june", "july", "august", "semptember", "october"))
rand_factor
```

    ##  [1] january    february   march      april      may        june      
    ##  [7] july       august     semptember october   
    ## 10 Levels: april august february january july june march may ... semptember
