# Problem 1

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Generate a uniform distribution from 0 to 5. 

```{r}
rand_samp = runif(10, min = 0, max = 5)
rand_samp

```

The mean of the sample is `r mean(rand_samp)`.

Generate a logical vector, which indicates whether the elements in the sample are greter than 2.

```{r}
rand_samp_greater_than_2 = rand_samp > 2
rand_samp_greater_than_2
```

The mean of the logical vector is `r mean(rand_samp_greater_than_2)`.

Generate a character vector, which includes ten elements.
```{r}
rand_char = c("My", "name", "is", "Qinyao", "how", "are", "you", "nice", "weather", "today")

```

The mean of the character vector is `r mean(rand_char)`.


```{r}
rand_factor = factor(c("january", "february", "march", "april", "may", "june", "july", "august", "semptember", "october"))
rand_factor

```

```{r}

```
